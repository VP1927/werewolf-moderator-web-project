The villagers are trying to interpret the actions of other players and deduce who the wolves are. The seer is trying to throw suspicion on the wolves (if he knows who they are) and keep it off players she knows to be innocent -- but she must do this subtly, because if the werewolves figure out who the seer is, they will kill her during the night (since the seer is the biggest threat to the werewolves).\n\t\t\t\t\t<br/>Again, dead players are excluded from this hullabaloo. They can listen all they want, but may not say anything.\n\t\t\t\t\t<br/>A few things that always seem to come up: Yes, a majority of all living players, including the person being voted on; if there are 10 players alive, for example, there must be 6 votes on one player to lynch (5 is not enough). Yes, there must be a lynching every day; no namby-pamby we-don't-wanna-lynch-anybody nonsense in this village.\n\t\t\t\t\t<br/>Also, it is important that the moderator pay close attention to the voting. As soon as a majority of players is voting for a single victim, that victim is immediately dead and night begins. Any last words or pleas for mercy must be given before the majority rules; once the lynch takes place, the lynched person may not say anything more for the rest of the game.\n\t\t\t\t\t<br/>After a player is lynched, night phase begins immediately; no further discussion is permitted until the following day.\n\t\t\t\t\t<br/>Dead players are permitted to keep their eyes open at all times, and thus see everything that happens at night, but of course they must keep quiet about it so as not to influence the actions of the living players.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4 className='supSec'>Victory</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p className='context'>\n\t\t\t\t\tIf at any time the number of wolves is equal to or greater than the number of non-wolves, the wolves win.
